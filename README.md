# Tableau FIFA World Cup Story

The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is the biggest international soccer competition contested by the senior men's national teams. I use Tableau, one of the most popular data visualization tools to create a story about the greatest sport event in the world. 

Not a fancy visulization but there are some tricky techniques, and I love it!
